.. php:class:: Form

One of the most important views of Agile UI is a "Form" View, which will appear in your application just like this:

.. image:: images/form.png

Features of a Form include:

 - Rendering a valid HTML form:
    - including form fields
    - field grouping (more than one field per line)
    - adds and links labels, placeholders and hints
    - allows any "Field" variations (see :ref:`field`) - checkboxes, drop-downs, etc.
    - automatically sets ID for form/fields/labels
    - supports automated layouts or you can define a custom one

 - Integration with Model objects:
    - automatically populate all or specific fields
    - use of semi-automated layouting (you can arrange group of fields)
    - respect caption and other ui-related settings defined in a model
    - map field "type" into appropriate :ref:`field`

 - Augment Form with JS integration:
    - form is submitted using JavaScript
    - during submit, the loading indicator is shown
    - javascript sends data through POST
    - POST data is automatically parsed and imported into Model

 - You may define onSubmit PHP handler that:
    - can execute data validation, save data and make decisions in PHP code
    - display errors for single or multiple fields
    - perform custom actions on "input" element such as insert value
    - perform custom action on "field" div, such as use checkbox APIs
    - execute any other arbitrary JavaScript or jQuery code
    - indicate successful completion of a form through a nicely formatted message


Creating Basic Forms
---------------------

To create a form you need the following code::

    $form = new \atk4\ui\Form();
    $form->addField('email');

    $layout->add($form);

The first line creates a "Form" object that is assigned to variable `$f`. Next
line defines a new field that is placed inside a form.

Once form is defined, it needs to be placed somewhere in a Render Tree.

.. php:method:: addField(name)

    Create a new field on a form. If form is associated with a model, which have
    a field with a matching name, then field meta-information will be loaded from
    the model.

If $form is not yet associated with a model (like above) then an empty model will
be created. The arguments to addField are compatible with Model::addField()::

    $form->addField('is_accept_terms', ['type'=>'boolean']);

Additionally, any fields that are added into Form directly are marked with the
flag "never_persist".

.. php:method:: setModel($model, [$fields])

    Associate field with existing model object and import all editable fields
    in the order in which they were defined inside model's init() method.

    You can specify which fields to import and their order by simply listing
    field names through second argument.

    Specifying "false" or empty array as a second argument will import no fields.

.. php:attr:: model

    Model that is currently associated with a Form.

For the next demo, lets actually define a model::

    class Person extends \atk4\data\Model
    {
        public $table = 'person';

        public function init()
        {
            parent::init();
            $this->addField('name');
            $this->addField('surname');
            $this->addField('gender', ['enum' => ['M', 'F']]);
        }
    }

We can now populate form fields based around the fields as they are defined inside
a model. I will also add one extra checkbox where user can accept terms and conditions::

    $form = $layout->add('Form'); // using short version

    $form->setModel(new Person($db));

    $form->addField(
        'terms',
        ['type'=>'boolean', 'ui'=>['caption'=>'Accept Terms and Conditions']]
    );

Form Submit Handling
--------------------

.. php:method:: onSubmit($callback)

    Specify a PHP call-back that will be executed on successful form submission.

.. php:method:: error($field, $message)

    Create and return :php:class:`jsChain` action that will indicate error on a field.

.. php:method:: success($title, [$sub_title])

    Create and return :php:class:`jsChain` action, that will replace form with a success message.

.. php:attr:: successTemplate

    Name of the template which will be used to render success message.

To continue with my example, I'd like to add new Person record into the database
but only if they have also accepted terms and conditions. I can define onSubmit handler
that would perform the check, display error or success message::

    $form->onSubmit(function($form) {
        if (!$form->model['terms']) {
            return $form->error('terms', 'You must accept terms and conditions');
        }

        $form->model->save();

        return $form->success('Registration Successful', 'We will call you soon.');
    });

Callback function can return one or multiple JavaScript actions. Methods such as
:php:meth:`error()` or :php:meth:`success()` will help initialize those actions for your form. Here is a code
that can be used to output multiple errors at once. I intentionally didn't want to group
errors with a message about terms and conditions::

    $form->onSubmit(function($form) {
        $errors = [];

        if (!$form->model['name']) {
            $errors[] = $form->error('name', 'Name must be specified');
        }

        if (!$form->model['surname']) {
            $errors[] = $form->error('surname', 'Surname must be specified');
        }

        if ($errors) {
            return $errors;
        }

        if (!$form->model['terms']) {
            return $form->error('terms', 'You must accept terms and conditions');
        }

        $form->model->save();

        return $form->success('Registration Successful', 'We will call you soon.');
    });

At the time of writing, Agile UI / Agile Data does not come with a validation library, but
you can use any 3rd party validation code.

Callback function may raise exception. If Exception is based on ``\atk4\core\Exception``,
then the parameter "field" can be used to associate error with specific field::

    throw new \atk4\core\Exception(['Sample Exception', 'field'=>'surname']);

If 'field' parameter is not set or any other exception is generated, then error will not be
associated with a field. Only the main Exception message will be delivered to the user.
Core Exceptions may contain some sensitive information in parameters or back-trace, but those
will not be included in response for security reasons.


Form Layout
-----------

When you create a Form object and start adding fields through either :php:meth:`addField()` or
:php:meth:`setModel()`, they will appear one under each-other. This arrangement of fields as
well as display of labels and structure around the fields themselves is not done by a form,
but another object - "Form Layout". This object is responsible for the field flow, presence
of labels etc.

.. php:method:: setLayout(FormLayout\Generic $layout)

    Sets a custom FormLayout object for a form. If not specified then form will automatically
    use FormLayout\Generic.

.. php:attr:: layout

    Current form layout object.

.. php:method:: addHeader($header)

    Adds a form header with a text label. Returns View.

.. php:method:: addGroup($header)

    Creates a sub-layout, returning new instance of a :php:class:`FormLayout\Generic` object. You
    can also specify a header.

.. php:class:: FormLayout\Generic

    Renders HTML outline encasing form fields.

.. php:attr:: form

    Form layout objects are always associated with a Form object.

.. php:method:: addField()

    Same as :php:class:`Form::addField()` but will place a field inside this specific layout
    or sub-layout.

My next example will add multiple fields on the same line::

    $form->setModel(new User($db), false);  // will not populate any fields automatically

    $form->addFields(['name', 'surname']);

    $gr = $form->addGroup('Address');
    $gr->addFields(['address', 'city', 'country']); // grouped fields, will appear on the same line

By default grouped fields will appear with fixed width. To distribute space you can either specify
proportions manually::

    $gr = $f->addGroup('Address');
    $gr->addField('address', ['width'=>'twelve']);
    $gr->addField('code', ['Post Code', 'width'=>'four']);

or you can divide space equally between fields. I am also omitting header for this group::

    $gr = $f->addGroup(['n'=>'two']);
    $gr->addFields(['city', 'country']);

You can also use in-line form groups. Fields in such a group will display header on the left and
the error messages appearing on the right from the field::

    $gr = $f->addGroup(['Name', 'inline'=>true]);
    $gr->addField('first_name', ['width'=>'eight']);
    $gr->addField('middle_name', ['width'=>'three', 'disabled'=>true]);
    $gr->addField('last_name', ['width'=>'five']);

Semantic UI modifiers
---------------------

There are many other classes Semantic UI allow you to use on a form. The next code will produce
form inside a segment (outline) and will make fields appear smaller::

    $f = new \atk4\ui\Form(['small segment']));

For further styling see documentation on :php:class:`View`.
